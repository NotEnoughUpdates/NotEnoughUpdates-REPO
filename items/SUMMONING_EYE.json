    "A Summoning Eye is a special eye which can be placed in the Dragon Altar to summon a dragon, hence the name. To summon a dragon, you need to place down 8 Summoning eyes. A Summoning Eye can be obtained by killing Zealots. When killing a Zealot, you have a chance (1/420) for it to spawn a Special Zealot. A Special Zealot is spawned when you kill a Zealot and roll the chance and being successful. Summoning eyes go for around 580k-650k to the bazaar or the auction house."
